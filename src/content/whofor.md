## This course may not be for you if -

- You aren't sure whether you want to get started with your financial planning just yet. Though I'd recommend reading this and this and I'd add one can never be too early in working on this.
- You have already spent a large amount of time on your overall personal financial planning and it's 80% in place with just a few gaps.
