- On 3rd May 2020
  - Foram (my fianc√©e) : Abhishek, I have an extra INR X lakhs lying around - where should I invest it.
  - Me (in my head): F\*ck! I only know FDs and Startups and that's not a great answer to give to her now, is it.
  - Me (to her): Let me think about it and come back to you, hon.
- Approximately 4 months laters...
  - I've done my own work and created a course for helping you with your personal financial planning!
  - _P.S. Now, I give confident, specific and pointed answers to the missus, on anything investing and money management related._
